Loop game
============

Loop is a racing game inspired by runner arcade games positioned in a tube. The 3D feel emphasizes the speed and anticipation of obstacles. The goal is to collect as many points - stars as possible while avoiding the obstacles â€“ bombs. The game becomes progressively more difficult as more bombs stand in the way. You can have at the most two collisions (three lives), game over afterwards.

The Loop game was developed by Prof. Bart Jansen and his team - Lubos Omelina and Katarina Kostkova from ETRO Department of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and in collaboration with Prof. Eva Swinnen, specialist in rehabilitation sciences and Dr. Armand Laumen, pediatric orthopedic surgeon.
