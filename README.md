# OpenFeasyo
OpenFeasyo is a software platform for physical rehabilitation combining state-of-the-art (mostly low cost) motion sensors and various serious games.

The main goal is that our serious games:
* are configurable and adaptable to patientâ€™s needs
* support multiple input devices (accelerometers, 3D cameras, balance boards, EMG sensors) and their use at the same time
<!--- * can be configured while playing, either directly or from second screen application -->

Play our game Ghostly using touch or EMG sensors. More games and features are coming soon.
